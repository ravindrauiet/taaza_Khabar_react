# News Website
This project is a news website built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The main functionality of this website is to fetch and display news articles from various categories such as sports, health, business, technology, science, and general. The data for the articles is retrieved from the NewsAPI, a powerful API that provides access to a wide range of news sources.

## Features
### React Programming: 
The entire website is developed using React, which allows for efficient and modular development of user interfaces. React's component-based architecture enables the creation of reusable and maintainable code.

### Integration with NewsAPI: 
The project utilizes the NewsAPI to fetch news articles from a vast collection of sources. The API provides a straightforward and convenient way to access the latest news across different categories.

### Multiple Categories: 
Users can explore news articles from various categories such as sports, health, business, technology, science, and general. Each category offers a unique set of articles, providing a diverse range of news topics to explore.

### Customizable Article Display: 
The website allows users to customize the number of articles displayed at a time. This flexibility enables users to view more or fewer articles based on their preferences, ensuring a tailored news browsing experience.

### Component Variety: 
The project incorporates a wide range of components to handle different aspects of the website. These components include navigation bars, article cards, category selectors, pagination controls, and more. Each component is designed to provide a specific functionality and enhance the overall user experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
